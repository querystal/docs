# Dataset
Dataset are the first-class entity of Querystal.
There are two types of datasets:

*Platform Tables*
> Platform tables are those created and maintained by Querystal platform, which aim at supporting further development, such as on-chain blocks, events, transactions, logs. They drive the development of application-layer metrics. However, those tables are not essential in most of analytical works. They are relatively large in terms of size, and highlightely, they are updated in real-time.

*Metrics*
> Metrics are datasets with business insights, and it is encouraged to apply analytics directly on top of metrics. When consumers read any metrics, the cost paid will be shared with metrics producer as the incentive of their efforts.

> Metrics are relatively small in term of size and with clear dimensions, as the filters, and measures, as the business indicators.
