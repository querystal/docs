# Products

Querystal has three products provided. IAM, Meta Station and Workspace. Each product serves different use cases. Simply
speaking, Producers need to work closely with Workspace, while Consumers need to work closely with Meta Station. IAM is
for general permission and access management.

## Workspace

Workspace provides dataset exploration and dataset development toolkit, in which you are able to build your own dataset
by SQL, the ultimate programming language in Querystal, and publish the dataset with schedule trigger and upstream
evaluation.

## Meta Station

Meta Station provides a search engine of all datasets available in Querystal, in which you are able to locate your
desired datasets and understand the schema and models further.
Meta Station provides all essentials tips to help you consume the dataset seamlessly, and you can follow a producer to
be informed if any new dataset published.

## Identity & Access Management (IAM)

IAM provides general project and access management. You can invite a member, grant dataset access, manage your SQL files
by IAM.

### IAM Project

Project is a group of dataset and users to work together. And each user, file, dataset must belong to a valid project.
Querystal manages a default project, called Community, to gather all users when they firstly join the platform. This is
an open project without any strict control, in terms of participation, development, access etc. It highly recommended
for all users to contribute to the Community.

You can also create your own project to manage proprietary assets and work with your teammates in an isolated space.
Creation of a prop project requires Querystal approval. You can apply for it by send email. Please refer to
the [contact](../contact.md).
